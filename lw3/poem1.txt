Dear prosaist, d'you bustle about what?
Forget it! Just propose any thought:
I'll sharpen one its end as a cutting edge,
By a winged rhyme the other end I'll fledge,
My faithful bow with a tight string I'll bend,
And at a venture this killing arrow send;
So let it swish flying across the dark,
And, as we wish, will never miss the mark.
